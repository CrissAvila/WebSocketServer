# WEB SOCKET SERVER

## Description 

The WebSocket server provides a real-time communication solution between the client and the server. Unlike traditional HTTP protocols, which require the client to initiate requests to get responses from the server, WebSocket allows for a bidirectional and persistent communication. This means that both the client and the server can send data at any time, facilitating the construction of interactive applications such as online games, live chats, and real-time notifications. This server is designed to be efficient, scalable, and easy to integrate with existing web technologies, offering a solid foundation for developing modern web applications that require real-time interactions.
